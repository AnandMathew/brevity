A study performed at a well-known Midwestern United States university in 2012 asked students their reason for not complying with assigned course readings.By far the most common response was that students have “a work schedule that doesn’t allow...time for reading” [1].Yet, students can almost always expect reading to be a requirement for any given course, be it traditional textbooks, slide decks or online resources.However, traditional line-for-line reading can be a constant battle for the reader through irrelevant passages and moments of distraction.Rather than abandoning the troves of detailed knowledge contained in expository reading material, students and other avid learners need a way to approach readings in a more time-efficient manner, where information can be consumed and retained in a minimal amount of time
