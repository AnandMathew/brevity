No one seems to think that a Buddhist way of life would call for \nBuddhist economics, just as the modern materialist way of life has brought \nforth modern economics. If the job were done without \nany tools, the capital/output ratio would be infinitely large, but the \nproductivity per man would be exceedingly low. As economics deals with man in his \nenvironment, we may expect that meta-economics consists of two parts - one \ndealing with man and the other dealing with the environment. If the job were done at the \nhighest level of modern technology, the capital/output ratio would be low \nand the productivity per man very high. It is not good enough that in this crucial matter one should \nbe satisfied with one little group of private enthusiasts doing this work. One per cent, after \nall, is about E2t million - a sum of money which would go a very, very long \nway for this purpose if intelligently employed. It \ncannot mean the concentration of all power at one point, because that would \nimply the end of freedom: genuine planning is co-extensive with power. Even children would \nbe allowed to make themselves useful, even old people. There is no suggestion that the \nworld would have reached the end of its oil resources; but it would have \nreached the end of oil growth. \n \n If oil consumption continued to grow at roughly seven per cent per annum, \nit would rise to about 4,000 million tons a year in 1980. They have \nascertained that in order to put a man to work you need on average so much \nelectricity, so much cement, and so much steel. It could well be that rich people treasure peace more \nhighly than poor people. \nbefore World War II, who calculated that it took the work of thirty peasants \nto keep one man or woman at a university. India is quite big enough to be a relatively \nclosed society in that sense - a society in which the able-bodied people work \nand produce what they need. We must therefore construct a political system so perfect \nthat human wickedness disappears and everybody behaves well, no matter \nhow much wickedness there may be in him or her. I would say, without going into any details, you are lucky \nif you can make it five per cent. One \nrelates to agriculture, still the greatest single activity of man on earth, and \nthe other relates to industrial technology. It \nremains true, however, that agriculture is primary, whereas industry is \nsecondary, which means that human life can continue with- out industry, \nwhereas it cannot continue without agriculture. It would \nobviously be impossible to develop any economic theory at all, unless one \nwere prepared to disregard a vast array of qualitative distinctions. It means \nconducting the economic affairs of man as if people really did not matter at \nall.
